        <h1> The Reclaim Application</h1>
        <p>The Reclaim team will be working towards creating an app that encourages individuals to take on at least one additional sustainability practice at home. The intention of this application is to reduce the overall household waste and further educate individuals on the practices that can be undertaken to meet this aim. The following goals outline the numerous aspects and features of the application that will assist in meeting this overall aim with more specific targets around types of waste and how the user interacts with the app. It has been split into main goals and secondary goals. Main goals are those that the team feels has higher priority over the secondary goals which are important, however, not necessary in meeting the aim of the application.  </p>
