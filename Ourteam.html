      <h2> Steph Briggs</h2>
      <p>My name is Steph and I grew up on the Mornington Peninsula in Victoria. I was born in Australia and everyone as far back as my great-great-grandparents have been born in here in Victoria. My ancestors mostly originated from Europe with a
        mixture of Irish, English and German. I have previously attended RMIT a few ago where I completed an Associate Degree and Bachelor in Fashion Design, this being the reason I have chosen to study with RMIT once again. My interest in IT started
        from quite a young age, but in my early teens was when I really started to enjoy learning about building websites so I started using basic HTML and chat widgets to create websites for my school friends. I hope to be able to gain a further
        understanding of programming languages and software development throughout my studies as I would like to move into a career in this area. Outside of work and studies I enjoy hobbies such as skateboarding, snowboarding and pottery.</p>

      <h2>Justine Frost</h2>
      <p>I am 22 and I was born and raised in Melbourne. Although, my years growing up were split between there and San Diego, as I hold dual citizenship to the United States. Having parents from across the globe definitely comes with perks. Which in
        this case was my dad, where as my mother’s side migrated from Syria to Australia many years ago. My nationality is an ironic mix that’s for sure. I attended all my schooling in inner city Melbourne and completed my secondary studies at
        University High School. Completing high school encouraged me to take a gap year, which sent me straight into the work force – and have yet to start in tertiary studies, so here we are! I found myself sinking a few years into a Barista
        position, which followed a few bar tending and general hospitality roles. Over the past few years I’ve really embraced and channelled myself a creative side, found an outlet in ceramics, I took classes for about a year and then it became
        something I just always wanted to do, even when I was occupied at work, I couldn’t stop thinking about going home and getting my hands dirty. It is definitely the most satisfying ways to switch your mind off. Studying IT was always an option
        for me, considering my interest has stemmed from when I was a young gal. My dad actually introduced me to it all so it’s been something that has been around for as long as I could remember. In his spare time, or whenever we hung out, he was
        always showing me some program that he had been making or the latest computer he was building. I have very fond memories of always tripping over computer shells and stacks of motherboards and disk drives. I also loved tagging along to work
        with him, heading up to the IT department of the National Australia Bank was very exciting, my dad was part of the team that wrote the initial software to start up and develop online banking. Knowing those kinds of job still exist is
        definitely motivation to get into development.</p>

      <h2>Kirby Schwenke</h2>
      <p>My name is Kirby Schwenke, I am 25 and based in Sydney. I enjoy spending time with my pets, turning my one-bedroom apartment into a plant sanctuary, walking my way around Sydney, or using my creativity to create anything from a chair to a
        new planter box. I have previously completed a Bachelor of Management in Events and Leisure and worked in the event's industry since graduating. I was drawn to study in the IT industry as I have always been someone that thrives in an
        environment that fosters creativity and analytical thinking, and the IT industry presents many opportunities to apply this. I have previously used drag-and-drop website editors to create event and registration websites and often found myself
        lost in an internet rabbit hole researching HTML and CSS so that I could alter my websites and make them more dynamic and engaging. I have also worked with several technologies including, event registration software, project management
        software and file management software. I am interested in exploring more of UI/UX Design to improve the usability of software for individuals and industry professionals.</p>

      <h2>Blair Horgan</h2>
      <p>My name is Blair Horgan, I am pushing 48 this year and loving it. I’ve spent the last few years as a freelance photographer and photojournalist. I have a few hobbies that I enjoy, and these include photography, gaming, and electronics. I
        tend to travel a lot, with most of my time spent in either Thailand or Bali. I have always had an interest in IT and all things techy for a long time now. Working as a photographer/ journalist I’ve had to learn a lot of the IT techy stuff as
        I’m a one man show and don’t have the IT backing of a large media outlet, so I do it all on my own. Being able to connect to the cloud anyway and be able to edit and submit my photos via Adobe Creative Cloud is how I get things done. I also
        have a love for graphic designs and making visual stuff and so I guess it goes hand in hand with wanting to get involved in UIX/UI and even Web design. I guess I picked to study at RMIT because it suited my needs for where I wanted to go in
        the IT industry.</p>
